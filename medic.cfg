//~~~EwanLan's medic config~~~
//~~~~Features~~~~
//Crosshair/viewmodel switcher(Will include pictures off crosshairs for use)
//Medic radar
//Several healing methods(Mainly preference)
//Uber masking with randomized voice lines
//Uber faking
//Spawn rotation(when you spawn before you cap a objective that moves your spawn forward)
//Allows for more open customization

//Crosshair switcher
//Below will help you edit crosshairs, Crosshair colour and more
//
//		Sets slots	  Sets scale of crosshair  Crosshair type		R value of crosshair	G value of crosshair  B value of crosshair  Viewmodel on or off	 Viewmodel fov of wep   interp scale for projectiles, flamethowers and uber
//			  V              V						V						V						V						V					V					V					V
alias Med1 "slot1; cl_crosshair_scale 40; cl_crosshair_file crosshair3; cl_crosshair_red 0; cl_crosshair_green 180; cl_crosshair_blue 0; r_drawviewmodel 1; viewmodel_fov 84; cl_interp 0.0152; fm_default"
alias Med2 "fire; slot2; cl_crosshair_scale 40; cl_crosshair_file crosshair3; cl_crosshair_red 123; cl_crosshair_green 34; cl_crosshair_blue 200; r_drawviewmodel 0; viewmodel_fov 84; cl_interp 0.0152; fm_medigun"

//Slots shoud be untouched aswell as interp
//Crosshair scale   min = 0  max = 40

//Crosshair type 	To edit change the number after crosshair to one of these
//1 = cross with dot   2 = halfcross with dot    3 = ring    4 = X
//5 = Dot   6 = Cross no dot    7 = full cross
//or if you want to use tf2 default crosshair for it, e.g. medics cross for medigun replace
// crosshairX with default

//the RGB for the crosshair colour goes from 0 to 255
//use a rgb colour picker to get the colour and input the value
//into the appropriate slots

//draw viewmodel is a toggle, 0 being off and 1 being on you will still have tracers and particles from
//first person so its best to either to set r_drawtracers to 0 or to set viewmodel fov to 0152
//viewmodel fov sets how the fov of the viewmodel is, smaller will condense it inwards while larger will expand it outwards

//Medic radar
//If you are separated from your team and cant communicate to them, this is perfect
//I would not suggest using this if you are surrounded by teammates, as it annoys the fuck out of you.
//Change autocall_default to what you want the automatic callout percentage to be
alias "autocall_default" "hud_medicautocallersthreshold 80"
alias "autocall_all" "hud_medicautocallersthreshold 150"
alias "+radar" "autocall_all"
alias "-radar" "autocall_default"

//Healing
//There are 3 different healing styles for the medigun
//Inverted mouse1,Toggle mouse1 and holding

//Inverted heal
//Your medigun will always healing, by pressing your set key you will stop healing
//this will make the commands fire, fm_default and fm_medigun in the crosshair switcher
//function, be careful as this can be a pain to uninstall once used
//uncomment the lines below below

//tf_medigun_autoheal 1
//alias fm_medigun "+attack; alias +fire -attack; alias -fire +attack" 

//Toggle heal
//Pressing your set key will heal and will constantly heal till you click off to a empty area or another heal target
//Just uncomment the command below

//tf_medigun_autoheal 1

//holding
//Just uncomment the command below

//tf_medigun_autoheal 0

//Do not touch this command
alias fm_default "-attack; alias +fire +attack; alias -fire -attack"

//Spawn rotation
//Upon double-tapping your set key in spawn you will move your spawn up depending on the objective and progress
//If you have a decent uber advantage I will not suggest using spawn rotation as you will lose your current
//ubercharge progress

//If you are lazy and dont want to change all your loadout into the first slot you
//can change load_itempreset to the corresponding values
//A loadout = 0  B loadout = 1  C loadout = 2  D loadout = 3
//movespawn_first will be the loadout you change to and movespawn_second is your default loadout
//you will swap to
alias "movespawn_first" "load_itempreset 1; alias "movespawn" "movespawn_second""
alias "movespawn_second" "load_itempreset 0; alias "movespawn" "movespawn_first""
alias "movespawn" "movespawn_first"

//Uber masking
//Uber masking allows you to stop the medic calling out that he has charged, which can effect
//how the opposing team positions and plays.
//To use effectively hit your set key between 98-99% uber. it also makes use of a voice randomizer to
//stop the enemy from getting used to your uber calls
//the message may be changes to whatever suits you

alias maskmsg "say_team uber masked! 100% charge"
alias "maskuber" "mask1; maskmsg"
alias "mask1" "voicemenu 2 1;alias maskuber mask2; maskmsg"

alias "mask6" "voicemenu 2 6;alias maskuber mask7; maskmsg"
alias "mask7" "voicemenu 2 7;alias maskuber mask1; maskmsg"

//uber faking
//Fakes that you have uber, this can be effective for forcing the team back if they have a lack of uber to play defencelessly
//the message may be changes to whatever suits you
alias fakeuber "voicemenu 1 7; say_team Uber Faked to Enemy"

//team uber alert
//When you pop your uber, your team is alerted in chat.
//the message may be changes to whatever suits you
alias uber "+attack2 ;say_team Uber Popped"
